# P10-6-Python-Project
Project 2: This project is about creating a sentiment analysis on the movie “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”. The dataset we will be using is from Kaggle. We will use the given sentiment dictionary – AFINN to implement it into our system. With this, our team will program a system to calculate the sentiment scores of each sentence and identify the most positive and negative reviews.

All in all, this project involves programming and developing a backend logic for sentiment computation that entails a basic frontend for visualisation.
